# RPG

Hobby project for practicing Java, a small 2D dungeon crawler with turn based mechanics.
Sprites used are from the internet, not my property and probably should include some licence here.

The project uses javaFX for visuals, which you may or may not need to unlock in your build path.
The few tests I wrote need junit4 and hamcrest2 to build
